## A bit about history of dailypractice.info

I wrote a tiny single page Mathematics practice! where my son could daily practice multiplication and addition! Quickly realized that he doesn't like it, it lacks fun of games and dopamine factor! At the same time, being myself grew up in slum/very-poor area, I have been craving to teach for kids where I grew up (I have a couple of years of free teaching), Hence brain-stormed with another friend of mine, he swiftly got into action and hosted a website! Now both of us experimenting an idea that is fusion between Atomic-Habits + Maths. Oveall this is based on "Open service", people who wants to gain and/or serve for better future.

## What is our goal!

* Every kids has to get equal and quality education for free. We are opinionated that Parents are the one who play major role here than school!
* Unfortunately not every parents would realize, for few earning bread for their kid is dailypractice, we have to support them now!
* It should be Mathematics centered. Kids has to learn to understand the only universal language that is applicable for everyone under the sun!
* Every parents can measure and appreciate their kids daily! Here dopamine comes from parents appreciation (everyone has to care for everybody, sometime unknown, you may be appreciating a kid who has lots of disadvantage mentally/physically/economically)
* Open service = Open source + Social Service


## We have two option for SSP1

* We can have dedicated group only for our kids for SSP1
* They can compete with kids across global (Predominantly from India, Many of them are from poor background)!


## What is required from you as a parent

* Commiment to follow your guideline (and contribute to your guideline!)


* Another one paid version! Let us charge for additional fee, and use the cost for the benefit of poor kids (some years from now!)
