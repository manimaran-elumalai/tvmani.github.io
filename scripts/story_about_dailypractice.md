## A bit about history of dailypractice.info

I started with a tiny single page Mathematics practice tool, where my son could daily practice multiplication and addition (today it has lots of other tricks)! Quickly realized that he doesn't like it, it lacks fun of games and dopamine factor! 

At the same time, being myself grew up in slum/very-poor area, I have been craving to teach for kids where I grew up (I already have a couple of years of free teaching experience), Hence brain-stormed with another friend of mine who dedicated his life for kids education, he swiftly got into action and hosted a website! Started sharing with teachers in remote villege! 

Now both of us experimenting idea that is fusion between Atomic-Habits + Maths + Social Service. Oveall we term it as "Open service", people who wants to gain and/or serve for better future.

## What is our goal?

* Every kids has to get equal and quality education for free. We are opinionated that Parents are the one who play major role here than school!
* Unfortunately not every parents would realize, for few earning bread for their kid is dailypractice, we have to support them somehow!
* It should be Mathematics centered. Kids have to learn to understand the only universal language that is applicable for everyone under the sun!
* Here dopamine comes from parents appreciation (everyone has to care for everybody, sometime unknown, you may be appreciating a kid who has lots of disadvantage mentally/physically/economically)
* Open service = Open source + Social Service
* With daily practice, every kid is better two weeks from now than two-weeks younger version of himself! No other comparisions!
* Piece of software alone doesn't work well! We need cheerleaders! Kids like appreciation!


## What is required from you as a parent?

* Commiment to follow your guideline (and contribute to your guideline!)
* Strictly no comparision!
* Every parent can measure and appreciate their kids daily!


## We have two option for SSP1

* We can have dedicated group only for our kids for SSP1
  * Someday we can align with what is required for school, but it is deviating from the original goal (dailypractice is for knowledge! not for marks!)
  * We can customize about how we opreate!
* They can compete with kids across global (Predominantly from India, Many of them are from poor background)!
  * You can help some unknown kid from Bangladesh/India/Singapore just by acting like cheer leader!
  * Group is already mature, so we can learn from their experience
* Mix and match
  * Anyone who wants to spend 2 minutes to cheerup some unknow kid can join the other group! Still their kids can be part of SSP1-Dailypractice!
  * Whatever we could come up with!
